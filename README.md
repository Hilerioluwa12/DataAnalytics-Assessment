# Data Analyst Assessment Submission

## Approach
1. **Question 1**: Used joins to link customers with both savings and investment plans, filtering by plan type.
2. **Question 2**: Categorized customers using a CTE and `CASE` statements.
3. **Question 3**: Identified inactive accounts by comparing dates.
4. **Question 4**: Derived CLV using tenure and transaction metrics.

## Challenges
- Assumed `is_active` flag exists for Question 3 (clarification needed).
- Handled kobo-to-currency conversion in all monetary fields.
